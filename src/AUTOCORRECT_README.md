# Autocorrect
#### A word-suggestion project created by Beckett Porter for Adventures in Algorithms at Menlo School in Atherton, CA
## How To Use:
Run the program and enter your word. If the word is misspelled, the program will then return you the most similar words that might have been what you meant to type. If there are no similar words found, it will tell you that no matches were found. If the word is typed correctly, nothing will happen and you will be prompted to enter another word. Type "exit" to leave the program.
