Also shared it to github. |

I have a rough draft of it now and I tried it in an online code editor because I can't get it to print anything out here because of the tests and it was decently close. It definitely was off in certain cases but it sometimes got it correct, better than nothing. |

I found some with the base cases and fixed it and it seems like it is actually working now? There was also an issue with my replace step where I was incorrectly creating the new string after replacing a letter. |

I need to use two indices to track where I am in both words independently, because they will not always be at the same index. Now I am going to start on my find possible candidates method, I am going to try to use hashing for this. |

It's pretty convoluted right now but I'm just trying to get something working. Good chance I'll either completely redo it or at least heavily change it to make it make more sense. |

I modified it so that it now does hashes for multiple nGram sizes that the user can define. The more the nGram sizes to check, the more accurate, but slower it will be. I also am going through and cleaning up my code and commenting because it was honestly a mess before. |
| March 22nd |        11:15 - 12:55 pm        | I worked a lot on optimizing the algorithm and also fixing bugs. I fixed some issues with certain length words causing the program to throw errors due to how I was making the nGrams. I also added a method that culls any words from the possible candidates that are significantly different in length to the target word, this helped A LOT with the time for long words. I also made a little profiling tool to figure out how long each part of my program was taking, as I wasn't sure whether the get candidates method was the bottleneck of the edit distances (I actually learned this technique yesterday at a talk from GDC lol). The edit distance was taking a super long time with a large number of longer words, which is why cutting down the possible candidates based on how different in length they are helped a lot because it reduced the number of times findEditDistance has to be run. I also fixed the formatting of some things and made it not do anything if the word is not typed incorrectly. I think at this point the program is basically done so I'm just going to do a final run through with commenting and then I think it is ready to submit. Oh and I also made a readMe file. |
| March 23rd |         2:15 - 2:40pm          |                                                                         I worked on optimizing for longer words and I actually managed to decrease the runtime significantly. By checking for larger matching nGrams (I went from 3 letters to 4 letters to check max), it gives more similar candidate results and barely increases the time required since the find candidates step is already really fast. I figured this out with the help of my profiler, which is why I also know that the slowest part is the findEditDistance method. By getting these more accurate results, I can reduce the number of possible candidates I need to get because they are more accurate and this helped reduce the number of calls to findEditDistance, speeding the algorithm up a lot. I'm gonna make one last look through and see if there are any other optimizations I can make and I also want to make a little loading or thinking indicator when the program is fetching the autocorrect results. Ok I just did that and it works well. I also added a little "Did you mean: " text to indicate that the words we are giving them are possible words they might have meant to type. I think it is basically ready now. |
