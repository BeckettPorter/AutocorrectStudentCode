| April 5    |             9-10pm             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |

Also shared it to github. |
| March 11th | 9:40 - 9:55am, 11:20 - 11:35am | I began by working on the edit threshold method. I have a rough draft of it now and I tried it in an online code editor because I can't get it to print anything out here because of the tests and it was decently close. It definitely was off in certain cases but it sometimes got it correct, better than nothing. |
